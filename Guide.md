## Preface

I've always imagined Black Templars as more of a knight order with individual heraldry and accolades for each member
rather than an amourphous blob of black-and-white models only distinguished by the occasional use of chequered patterns.
I'm trying to use constrast to break up the models and use non-black armour panels wherever possible as well as 
using varying colours for ribbons attached to the armour and doing individual freehand of tilting shields.
